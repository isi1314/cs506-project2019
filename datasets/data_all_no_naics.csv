Founded by Yoram, Exalink was acquired by Comverse in 2000, where Eran became VP of Product Marketing and Yoram was CTO of Comverse Mobile.At Comverse, Eran saw mobile applications that were created locally in Israel fail to perform when tested on local firmware in cellular networks in other countries, such as the U.S. Eran envisioned a way to test these apps remotely in real-world scenarios of other environments. Later, we would come to call this a “cloud device lab.”Soon after, Yoram began noticing the limitations of manual testing on mobile phones. As the number of browsers and models of phones increased, the problem multiplied – and it continues to do so to this day."
